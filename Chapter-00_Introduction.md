## Chapter-00_Introduction
Imagine a world in which you can input your age, lifestyle, and genetic information (genome) into an app and obtain personalized recommendations about the food you should eat or avoid and behaviors you should modify to help maintain your health. Moreover, imagine what when you  are sick, your physician inputs the same information to determine your customized treatment plan. That world is not 50 years into the future; in many respects it is beginning to unfold now. This book will reveal the essentials of personalized medicine (sometimes referred to as precision or individualized medicine), what is it, how will it affect you when you are healthy and when you are sick, and how personalized medicine will be implemented based on your DNA and other information.
